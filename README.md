# What is AR_Tourism
AR Tourism is an augmented reality (AR) geolocated application designed to enhance the experience of tourists as they explore cultural and tourist sites. Through its interactive interface, users can access contextual information and enriched visualizations of the places they visit, directly on their mobile device screens. Using the phone's camera, AR Tourism overlays historical data, cultural details, and virtual reconstructions over real-world images, offering an immersive and educational experience.

The application not only displays static information but also allows users to interact with the content, participate in location-based games and activities, and receive personalized recommendations based on their interests and history of previous visits. AR Tourism aims to transform the way tourists interact with their surroundings, turning every visit into a dynamic and memorable learning experience.

With advanced geolocation features provided by Mapbox and the augmented reality capabilities of AR Foundation and ARCore, AR Tourism facilitates navigation through points of interest, enhances access to valuable cultural information, and promotes more sustainable tourism by spreading tourist attention more evenly across various locations.
